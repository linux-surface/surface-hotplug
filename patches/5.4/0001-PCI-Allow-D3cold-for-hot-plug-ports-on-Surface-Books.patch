Subject: [PATCH 1/3] PCI: Allow D3cold for hot-plug ports on Surface Books

The Microsoft Surface Book series of devices have a tablet part (so
called clipboard) that can be detached from the base of the device.
While the clipboard contains the CPU, the base can contain a discrete
GPU (dGPU). This dGPU is connected via a PCIe hot-plug port.

Currently D3cold is disallowed for all hot-plug ports. On the Surface
Book 2 and 3, this leads to increased power consumption during suspend
and when the dGPU is not used (i.e. runtime suspended). This can be
observed not only in battery drain, but also by the dGPU getting notably
warm while suspended and not in D3cold.

Testing shows that the Surface Books behave well with D3cold enabled for
hot-plug ports, alleviating the aforementioned issues. Thus white-list
D3cold for hot-plug ports on those devices.

Note: PCIe hot-plug signalling while the device is in D3cold is handled
via ACPI, out-of-band interrupts, and the surface_hotplug driver
(combined). The device will work without the surface_hotplug driver,
however, device removal/addition will only be detected on device resume.
